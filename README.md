# TMT-SysML-Model for CSM Testing
### This branch of the model is for CSM testing ONLY!

The necessary information needed to test is provided below.

* how the model is structured 
-	The model overall is split into two parts, the TMT PO and the JPL side.
-	Each of these sides again contains the various aspects and sub-systems relevant for the respective side.
  o	The TMT Observatory side contains the Operational Domains and Flow Analyses as well as its WBS.
  o	The JPL side contains the APS and CS System Model (including its domains and analyses)
-	The structure is also documented in the “00 Start Here” package, specifically in the “TMT Overview Diagram”	

* which simulations can be used (we have about 20 complex ones)
	- 
	
* what are the expected results and how to understand they work as expected 
	- 

* which branches and versions to use
	The ‘se’ branch is used by the TMT Observatory and the ‘aps’ branch is used by the people at JPL. This is analogous to the structure described above.
